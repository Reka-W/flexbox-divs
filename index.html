            Hi, I'm Reka!
          </header>
          <main>I am a Responsive Designer & Developer who thrives on visual storytelling. When I'm not working, pursuing side projects, or getting lost in the rabbit hole of blogs & books, I can be found traveling, hiking, and searching for new stories.</main>

                <p>I was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. My grandmother was the matriarch of the family, having six children and lots of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Being so close to my family, it took quite a bit of effort for me to move away and go to college. But, once I left home, I never completely moved back.</p>

          <div class="div-2 flex items">
                <p>I completed my undergraduate studies at Elizabeth City State University - a small HBCU in the north-east corner of NC. After completing one tour in the military, I earned my master of arts at Clayton State University in Morrow, Georgia in the suburbs of Metro Atlanta.</p>

          <div class="div-3 flex items">
                <p>In 2006, immediately after earning my first degree, I enlisted in the United States Navy. I trained for my position as an Arabic Cryptologist in Monterey, California. Once I was able to show that I was fluent in Arabic and could do my job well, I was stationed at Fort Gordon in Augusta, Georgia. I served at Fort Gordon until I separated from the Navy in 20012.</P>
